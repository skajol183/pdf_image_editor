# PDF/Image Editor React Application using Javascript, React.js, Saas (CSS Preprocessor)
[PDF/Image Editor](https://pdf-image-editor.vercel.app/) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that's part of the PSPSFKit and for Image I am using pqina(pintura, react-pintura). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.

# Setting up the UI 
Firstly, the design is completely mine, its is an important part that I always try to maintain in all of my projects.
The home page design was build using a SASS css. The responsive design of the page using media queries will run when opened in a mobile-device. All the other components were created on top of these main components 

# Deployment
The app is deployed using Vercel.
